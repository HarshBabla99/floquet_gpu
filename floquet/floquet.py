    """Perform a floquet analysis to identify nonlinear resonances.

    In most workflows, one needs only to call the run() method which performs
    both the displaced state fit and the Blais branch analysis. For an example
    workflow, see the [transmon](../examples/transmon) tutorial.

    Parameters:
        model: Class specifying the model, including the Hamiltonian, drive amplitudes,
            frequencies
        state_indices: State indices of interest. Defaults to [0, 1], indicating the two
            lowest-energy states.
        options: Options for the Floquet analysis.
            ??? info "Detailed `opt_options` API"
                - fit_range_fraction (`float`, default: 1.0): Fraction of the amplitude
                    range to sweep over before changing the definition of the bare state
                    to that of the itted state from the previous range. For instance if
                    fit_range_fraction=0.4, then the amplitude range is split up into
                    three chunks: the first 40% of the amplitude linspace, then from
                    40% -> 80%, then from 80% to the full range. For the first fraction
                    of amplitudes, they are compared to the bare eigenstates for
                    identification. For the second range, they are compared to the
                    fitted state from the first range. And so on. Defaults to 1.0,
                    indicating that no iteration is performed.
                - floquet_sampling_time_fraction (`float`, default: 0.0): What point of
                    the drive period we want to sample the Floquet modes. Defaults to
                    0.0, indicating the floquet modes at t=0*T where T is the drive
                    period.
                - fit_cutoff (`int`, default: 4): Cutoff for the fit polynomial of the
                    displaced state.
                - overlap_cutoff (`float`, default: 0.8): Cutoff for fitting overlaps.
                    Floquet modes with overlap with the "bare" state below this cutoff
                    are not included in the fit (as they may be experiencing a
                    resonance).
                - nsteps (`int`, default: 30_000): QuTiP integration parameter, number
                    of steps the solver can take.
                - num_cpus (`int`, default: 1): Number of cpus to use in parallel
                    computation of Floquet modes over the different values of
                    omega_d, amp.
                - save_floquet_modes (`bool`, default: False): Indicating whether to
                    save the extracted Floquet modes themselves. Such data is often
                    unnecessary and requires a fair amount of storage, so the default is
                    False.
        init_data_to_save: Initial parameter metadata to save to file. Defaults to None.

        This function largely performs two calculations. The first is the Xiao analysis
        introduced in https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13656, fitting the extracted Floquet
        modes to the "ideal" displaced state which does not include resonances by design
        (because we fit to a low order polynomial and ignore any floquet modes with
        overlap with the bare state below a given threshold). This analysis produces the
        "scar" plots. The second is the Blais branch analysis, which tracks the Floquet
        modes by stepping in drive amplitude for a given drive frequency. For this
        reason the code is structured to parallelize over drive frequency, but scans in
        a loop over drive amplitude. This way the two calculations can be performed
        simultaneously.

        A nice bonus is that both of the above mentioned calculations determine
        essentially independently whether a resonance occurs. In the first, it is
        deviation of the Floquet mode from the fitted displaced state. In the second,
        it is branch swapping that indicates a resonance, independent of any fit. Thus
        the two simulations can be used for cross validation of one another.

        We perform these simulations iteratively over the drive amplitudes as specified
        by fit_range_fraction. This is to allow for simulations stretching to large
        drive amplitudes, where the overlap with the bare eigenstate would fall below
        the threshold (due to ac Stark shift) even in the absence of any resonances.
        We thus use the fit from the previous range of drive amplitudes as our new bare
        state.
